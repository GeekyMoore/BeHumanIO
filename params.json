  "body": "### Our Primary Directive\r\n* Be Human: don’t act like a machine to society, acknowledge them as we did pre-telephone.\r\n* IO: To perform an input or output operation between human and machine; electronics are always used.\r\n\r\nThe BeHuman.IO manifesto is a guideline to be be used for projects, experiments and exportation into the unknown, all under one common goal: for the betterment of society. Be them open source, free or paid, all their underlying use is to improve and enhance ourselves and others; never to add further technical jargon and comically long terms of service we've all become accustom too.\r\n\r\n### Manifesto Framework\r\n1. Never act automated when speaking to another human, use first names and reframe from use of automated messages\r\n2. Profit can be made off another but it should bring honest happiness, never sold on F.U.D.\r\n3. All code used should be made open source unless otherwise bought to speed development\r\n4. Updates and development statuses should always be made public\r\n5. Never use paywalls or require email lists to gain profit\r\n6. Ask as little as possible personal information when billing\r\n7. Dumb everything down like /r/explainlikeimfive/\r\n8. Sharing is caring. If asked how it's done, explain\r\n9. Some handicaps go beyond the 5 senses, adapt for these individuals\r\n10. When in doubt, ask for help. And always thank for another's time\r\n11. N.D.A. are No Don't Agree. Always be open\r\n12. Two pages of terms-of-service are one page too long\r\n13. One mans garbage is another mans inspiration. Always show your process\r\n14. Quit the one cent demotion listings and bump to grand total\r\n15. Never require another sign up to use the initial sign up\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with viewing this?
