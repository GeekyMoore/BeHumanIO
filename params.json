Be them open source, free or paid, all their underlying use is to improve and enhance ourselves. Mind and body.\r\n\r\n### Manifesto Guidelines\r\n1. Never act automated when speaking to another human, use first names and reframe from use of automated messages\r\n2. Profit can be made off another but it should bring honest happiness, never sold on F.U.D.\r\n3. All code used should be made open source unless otherwise bought to speed development\r\n4. Updates and development statuses should always be made public\r\n5. Never use paywalls or require email lists to gain profit\r\n6. Ask as little as possible personal information when billing\r\n7. Dumb everything down like /r/explainlikeimfive/\r\n8. Sharing is caring, be your inner nerd/geek and show how its made/works\r\n9. Some handicaps go beyond the 5 senses, adapt for these individuals\r\n10. When in doubt, ask for help.
