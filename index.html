<ul>
<li>Be Human: don’t act like a machine to society, acknowledge them as we did pre-telephone.</li>
<li>IO: To perform an input or output operation between human and machine; electronics are always used.</li>
</ul>

<p>BeHuman.IO is a series of projects, experiments and exportation into the unknown, all under one common goal: for the betterment of society. Be them open source, free or paid, all their underlying use is to improve and enhance ourselves. Mind and body.</p>
